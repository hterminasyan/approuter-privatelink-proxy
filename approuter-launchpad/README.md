# SAP Private Link service for frontend applications accessible from SAP Launchpad Service

As you might know, the SAP Launchpad service plays an important role to increase usersâ€™ productivity and efficiency by enabling organizations to establish a central point of access to SAP, custom-build, third-party applications, and extensions.  

The frontend extensions of your SAP S/4HANA system running on SAP BTP can now also benefit from the new SAP Private Link service by establishing private connectivity to your SAP backend systems.
